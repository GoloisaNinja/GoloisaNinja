# Hello! I'm Jon. Welcome to my GitHub! 👾
## I'm a Full Stack Developer that enjoys to build cool stuff.  Sometimes I build useful stuff, and sometimes I just build fun and entirely useless stuff! But regardless of the project, I'm always learning. 🌱
### A little background...
To say I had rough beginnings would be an understatement.  After floundering in several retail jobs, I took a job as a financial broker.  I would stay in this role for a decade before, along with several other life changes, I eventually just admitted my love affair with tech, and jumped in feet first.  I took a tech sector job in late 2014 and began writing code in 2015.  It was electric, that feeling when you know you are finally doing the thing you love.  It's been off to the races ever since. 
### A look at the stacks and technologies that I like to work in 💾
* JavaScript
* React
* Vue
* Gatsby
* NodeJS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Google Firestore
* GraphQL
* Strapi
* Shopify
* Netlify and Jamstack

### Here are some of the projects and applications I've created 🚀
#### Movie Partners
[![Movie Partners](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/moviePartners.png)](https://www.wewatch.pw)
> I built and designed Movie Partners because trying to manage watchlists with my wife was impossible - this app lets us share watchlist and mark movies and shows as favorites!  

#### Shortly
[![Shortly URL](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/shortly.png)](https://fpd.pw)
> Shortly is built with Vue and is bonafide URL shortener - because typing long urls is lame and hurts my wrists!  


#### Hat Attack!
![Hat Attack Site](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/hatattack.png)
> Hat Attack is a GatsbyJS frontend build that uses Shopify as CMS for inventory and payment processing!  


#### The Useddit Reddit Clone
![Reddit Clone](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/redditclone.png)
> Useddit is a VueJS clone of Reddit using VuexFire and Firestore for a real-time database that allows authentication with Google. Users can post texts, images, and gifs. Light/Dark theme switcher FTW! 


#### The Jcodes Dev Blog
![My Blog](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/blogRedesign.png)
> My GatsbyJS build that uses a decoupled Strapi CMS and GraphQL queries to snag all the dumb stuff I write using webhooks!
