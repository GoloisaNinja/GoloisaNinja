# Hello! I'm Jon. Welcome to my GitHub! üëæ
## I'm a Full Stack Developer that enjoys to build cool stuff.  Sometimes I build useful stuff, and sometimes I just build fun and entirely useless stuff! But regardless of the project, I'm always learning. üå±
### A little background...
To say I had rough beginnings would be an understatement.  After floundering in several retail jobs, I took a job as a financial broker.  I would stay in this role for a decade before, along with several other life changes, I eventually just admitted my love affair with tech, and jumped in feet first.  I took a tech sector job in late 2014 and began writing code in 2015.  It was electric, that feeling when you know you are finally doing the thing you love.  It's been off to the races ever since. 
### A look at the stacks and technologies that I like to work in üíæ
* JavaScript
* React
* Vue
* Gatsby
* NodeJS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Google Firestore
* GraphQL
* Strapi
* Shopify
* Netlify and Jamstack

### Here are some of the projects and applications I've created üöÄ
#### Movie Partners
[![Movie Partners](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/moviePartners.png)](https://www.wewatch.pw)
> I built and designed Movie Partners because trying to manage watchlists with my wife was impossible - this app lets us share watchlist and mark movies and shows as favorites!  

#### Shortly
[![Shortly URL](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/shortly.png)](https://fpd.pw)
> Shortly is built with Vue and is bonafide URL shortener - because typing long urls is lame and hurts my wrists!  


#### hello bourb(on)
[![HelloBourbon](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/hellobourbon.png)](https://hellogobourbon.netlify.app)
> Hello Bourbon is fullstack application with a React frontend, custom SCSS, and a custom Go backend API!   


#### OpenMarkIO
[![WYSIWYG](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/openmark.png)](https://openmarkio.netlify.app)
> OpenMarkIO is a WYSIWYG markdown editor that is a StackEdit.io clone - obviously not as good - but I baked in some cool features and wired it up to a firebase backend so users could save their creations! 


#### The Jcodes Dev Blog
![My Blog](https://github.com/GoloisaNinja/GoloisaNinja/blob/main/blogRedesign.png)
> My GatsbyJS build that uses a decoupled Strapi CMS and GraphQL queries to snag all the dumb stuff I write using webhooks!
